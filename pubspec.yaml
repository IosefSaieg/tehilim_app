  # The position of the splash image can be set with android_gravity, ios_content_mode, and

  # https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Gravity): bottom, center, 
  # center_horizontal, center_vertical, clip_horizontal, clip_vertical, end, fill, fill_horizontal,

  # To hide the notification bar, use the fullscreen parameter.  Has no affect in web since web 
  # has no notification bar.  Defaults to false.
  # NOTE: Unlike Android, iOS will not automatically show the notification bar when the app loads.
  #       To show the notification bar, add the following code to your Flutter app:
  #       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  #       SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIOverlays([SystemUiOverlay.bottom, SystemUiOverlay.top]);
  #fullscreen: true
  
  # If you have changed the name(s) of your info.plist file(s), you can specify the filename(s) 
  # with the info_plist_files parameter.  Remove only the # characters in the three lines below,
  # do not remove any spaces:
  #info_plist_files:
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Debug.plist'
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Release.plist'

  # To enable support for Android 12, set the following parameter to true.  Defaults to false.
